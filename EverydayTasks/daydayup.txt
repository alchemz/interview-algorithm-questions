A few things need to be updated for the code.
ValueError: Only call `sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits` with named arguments (labels=..., logits=..., ...)
1. logits = logits, labels = labels
WARNING:tensorflow:From train_feature_extraction.py:49: arg_max (from tensorflow.python.ops.gen_math_ops) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Use `argmax` instead
2. arg_max -> argmax
